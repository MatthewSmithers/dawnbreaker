The Weekly Basic will bring your clean up to the standard you desire and keep it that way. (See checklist)

        The Bi-weekly Essentials is an affordable and effective clean that caters to organized and busy households who desire a basic, sanitized clean; augmented with bi-weekly disinfecting of the stubborn and less noticeable (build-up) areas of the home. (See checklist)

        The Monthly Deluxe is designed for smaller, more organized households who can go a little longer between cleans and enjoy the benefits of a top-to-bottom professional clean on a monthly  basis. (See checklist)
